# Get Home Soon
Get Home Soon is a game created for the HackCarpathia competition. It highlights the contrast between younger and older generations, raising awareness about the challenges faced by the elderly, such as dementia, loneliness, and various health and social issues.
Our game brings this concept to life by presenting simple tasks that younger individuals can easily manage, yet these same tasks can be a struggle for older people.
