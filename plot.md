## Plot outline
### First Level
You are a young person who is helping his parents with groceries, you enjoy the world, see a beautiful sunset.
There is a bus driving next to you, the bus stop is a bit far away, but it’s alright, you just run for a moment and you get in to the bus a ride back home. The parents are there, there is a fireplace, it’s cozy and the dinner is prepared. You go back to the room, get in the bed and go to sleep.
### Last Level
You are an older person who is going back from grocery shopping, it’s cold, the sun is setting, you start coughing and you try to get your meds but you forgot about them. There is a bus driving next to you, the bus stop is a bit far away, you try to run but your health is not the same as you were young, you experience much fatigue and you trip and fall and everything gets dark.
You wake up. You are in a big city alone. It’s dark and only sparse street lights are lighting the road. You take your phone and try to call your son, he does not answer (you forgot his name). You try to find way home, encountering various events:
your eyes get blurry,
you have smaller vision,
you need to stop from time to time as you get tired - the dog chaises you,
you forget where you go - when you go back to the same place it becomes a different one,
you can get scammed by people on the street
When you finally manage to get back, you see an old home with spiderwebs, it’s looks cold. There is nobody inside. You take your meds.
